# `slr.cli`

## Purpose

Solar radiation gauge list; points to solar-radiation time-series files.

## Role In SWAT+

- Category: Climate.
- Usage class: `active scenario input`.
- Activation: `file.cio`.
- `Osu_1hru` status: `active`.
- Source inventory slot(s): `in_cli%slr_cli = "slr.cli"`.

## File Format

SWAT+ input files use a plain-text, free-format layout with space-delimited values. GitBook documents the general convention as a title line first, then usually a header line, with exceptions such as `file.cio` and files that add count or block-header lines.
This file is controlled by the master `file.cio` manifest in normal runs. A non-`null` entry activates the selected filename; `null` means the file slot is intentionally unused for that scenario.

Local demo evidence from `VSProj/SWAT/Osu_1hru/slr.cli`:

- Title/comment line: `slr.cli: Solar radiation file names - file written by SWAT+ editor 2023-03-22 04:22:29.078280`.
- Observed header line: `filename`.
- Nonblank records after the header: 1.
- First demo data record: `Imsilsol.slr`.

## Fields And Parameters

The table below is generated from the demo header. Meanings are practical working descriptions from the header name, local scenario context, and SWAT+ conventions; verify units and storage against the reader before citing them as final.

| Field | Working meaning | Demo value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `filename` | Referenced input file name, usually relative to the scenario folder. | `Imsilsol.slr` |

## Defaults And Conversions

- Defaults: use the source inventory filename and the `file.cio` slot state as the first default/activation check.
- Missing-file behavior: if the master file or upstream manifest uses `null`, SWAT+ treats that slot as inactive for the scenario.
- Numeric conversions: not yet traced for this page; inspect the reader for unit conversions, bounds checks, and derived runtime fields.

## Reader Path

- Source inventory: `SWATPLUS/swatplus/src/input_file_module.f90`.
- Source slot: `in_cli%slr_cli` defaulting to `slr.cli`.
- Candidate reader/source files: `SWATPLUS/swatplus/src/cli_smeas.f90`.

## Downstream Consumers

Climate station assignment and daily/subdaily weather forcing used by hydrology and plant-growth routines.

## Scenario Evidence

- Scenario: `VSProj/SWAT/Osu_1hru`.
- Scenario state: `active`.
- Activation evidence: `file.cio`.
- Local file evidence: `VSProj/SWAT/Osu_1hru/slr.cli`.

## Open Questions

- Which exact reader routine stores each field, and in which derived type or module variable?
- Which units, valid ranges, and default substitutions are enforced in that reader?
- Which routines consume each parsed value after initialization?
