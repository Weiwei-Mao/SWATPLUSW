# `graze.ops`

## Purpose

Grazing operation definitions.

## Role In SWAT+

- Category: Operations.
- Usage class: `active scenario input`.
- Activation: `file.cio`.
- `Osu_1hru` status: `active`.
- Source inventory slot(s): `in_ops%graze_ops = "graze.ops"`.

## File Format

SWAT+ input files use a plain-text, free-format layout with space-delimited values. GitBook documents the general convention as a title line first, then usually a header line, with exceptions such as `file.cio` and files that add count or block-header lines.
This file is controlled by the master `file.cio` manifest in normal runs. A non-`null` entry activates the selected filename; `null` means the file slot is intentionally unused for that scenario.

Local demo evidence from `VSProj/SWAT/Osu_1hru/graze.ops`:

- Title/comment line: `graze.ops: written by SWAT+ editor v2.2.0 on 2023-03-22 04:25 for SWAT+ rev.60.5.4`.
- Observed header line: `name                          fert        bm_eat      bm_tramp       man_amt    grz_bm_min  description`.
- Nonblank records after the header: 12.
- First demo data record: `dairy_high                dairy_fr      25.00000      10.00000       0.95000    3000.00000  High_Prod_Dairy-Fresh_Manure`.

## Fields And Parameters

The table below is generated from the demo header. Meanings are practical working descriptions from the header name, local scenario context, and SWAT+ conventions; verify units and storage against the reader before citing them as final.

| Field | Working meaning | Demo value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | Record name used by other input files to reference this parameter set. | `dairy_high` |
| `fert` | Field named in the demo/source header; trace the reader for exact units and storage. | `dairy_fr` |
| `bm_eat` | Field named in the demo/source header; trace the reader for exact units and storage. | `25.00000` |
| `bm_tramp` | Field named in the demo/source header; trace the reader for exact units and storage. | `10.00000` |
| `man_amt` | Field named in the demo/source header; trace the reader for exact units and storage. | `0.95000` |
| `grz_bm_min` | Minimum value or lower bound, depending on the reader. | `3000.00000` |
| `description` | Free-text description retained for reader/user context. | `High_Prod_Dairy-Fresh_Manure` |

## Defaults And Conversions

- Defaults: use the source inventory filename and the `file.cio` slot state as the first default/activation check.
- Missing-file behavior: if the master file or upstream manifest uses `null`, SWAT+ treats that slot as inactive for the scenario.
- Numeric conversions: not yet traced for this page; inspect the reader for unit conversions, bounds checks, and derived runtime fields.

## Reader Path

- Source inventory: `SWATPLUS/swatplus/src/input_file_module.f90`.
- Source slot: `in_ops%graze_ops` defaulting to `graze.ops`.
- Candidate reader/source files: `SWATPLUS/swatplus/src/mgt_read_grazeops.f90`.

## Downstream Consumers

Scheduled management-operation routines such as planting, harvest, grazing, irrigation, fire, and treatment.

## Scenario Evidence

- Scenario: `VSProj/SWAT/Osu_1hru`.
- Scenario state: `active`.
- Activation evidence: `file.cio`.
- Local file evidence: `VSProj/SWAT/Osu_1hru/graze.ops`.

## Open Questions

- Which exact reader routine stores each field, and in which derived type or module variable?
- Which units, valid ranges, and default substitutions are enforced in that reader?
- Which routines consume each parsed value after initialization?
